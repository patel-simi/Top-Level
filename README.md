the rquirements folder is used to install numpy as well as numpy*. The library of numpy allowed me to create a matrix with all the spaces =0. The library of numpy * allowed me to delete a column of the matrix I created.
I believe all this program requires is running it. The size, and calculations are all included by me the programer and the results produced will be the same everytime. If the size of the matrix needs to be changed that can be done on line 6, and the change in deleting a row or column can be done on line 27.
